# difference class-func (using hooks)

Simple rules needed to understand the difference in the use of state in different components

### `state` 

   //if you want to write all states into one variable .\
   //but now it will be necessary to access the object .\
   const [state , setState] = useState({count , done}); .\

   ChangeState = ()=>{ .\
      setState((state)=>({ .\
         ...state , done: !state.done .\
      })) .\
   }
